                  <h2>My Hometown</h2>
                  <p>Haidian was originally a village outside of Beijing's Inner City. It was first built in the Yuan Dynasty and became one of the eight major business areas of the capital during the Qing Dynasty and was the seat of such old shops as Lotus White, Quanjude and Hongbin House. The famed Old Summer Palace and Summer Palace, two grand imperial gardens are also among its reputed features. It became a university district after the building of the Tsinghua University and Yenching University campus in the early twentieth century. It is mentioned in Lao She's novel Camel Xiangzi as an academic village for students. After the foundation of the People's Republic, it was deliberately developed as a university area, with many of the Yan'an institutions moving there. It officially became an administrative district in June 1954. Since the reform and opening up, it has become the centre of China's IT industry. In the words of Time magazine:
                  <blockquote>“  Like Paris' Champs Elysées or New York's Broadway, Haidian is a celebration of a national myth: China's ability to change itself and become, once again, great among nations. ”</blockquote>
                  During the later half of the 1990s, out of the Beijing districts, Haidian had the highest per capita GDP. During that period the GDP of Haidian District grew by double digits each year.</p>

            <h3>Graphic Design Project: Adopt, Don't Shop</h3>
            <p>These poster designs aim to promote the idea of pet adoption from animal rescues as a substitution of purchasing from breeders, pet stores, etc. The posters consist of various types of elements: imagery of animals, abstract shapes and slogan text “Adopt. Don’t shop”. Image elements are either from online resources or created using Adobe Illustrator. The main themes and structures of the three designs are kept consistent so that they can work together and leave the audience a stronger impression.</p>
            <p>Personal comments: To me, the part that worked out the best in these posters is the text / font choice. I don’t want the posters to look like forcing people into pet adoption but at the same time, I feel like this issue still needs to be emphasized. That’s why I chose a script-like font (for a friendly tone) but also added a period after the word “adopt” (for determination). I made the text “adopt” significantly larger than “don’t shop” so that “adoption” can be the first thing that catches attention. One note is that the QR code placed at the bottom-right corner of each poster is a working one that directs to a local animal shelter.</p>

		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>My name is Mojin Yu. I am currently an undergraduate student at the University of Rochester, majoring in Digital Media Studies and Psychology. I have great passion in art, music and new media. Currenly I'm working for the History Department as a reserach assitent. <br>Contact: myu20@u.rochester.edu</p>

		<h2>Work Experiences</h2>
		<h3>SUMMER PROGRAM ASSISTANT | UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER | 2017 JUL - SEP</h3>

		<h2>Graphic Design Project: Adopt, Don't Shop</h2>

		<p>These poster designs aim to promote the idea of pet adoption from animal rescues as a substitution of purchasing from breeders, pet stores, etc. The posters consist of various types of elements: imagery of animals, abstract shapes and slogan text “Adopt. Don’t shop”. Image elements are either from online resources or created using Adobe Illustrator. The main themes and structures of the three designs are kept consistent so that they can work together and leave the audience a stronger impression.</p>

		<p>Personal comments: To me, the part that worked out the best in these posters is the text / font choice. I don’t want the posters to look like forcing people into pet adoption but at the same time, I feel like this issue still needs to be emphasized. That’s why I chose a script-like font (for a friendly tone) but also added a period after the word “adopt” (for determination). I made the text “adopt” significantly larger than “don’t shop” so that “adoption” can be the first thing that catches attention. One note is that the QR code placed at the bottom-right corner of each poster is a working one that directs to a local animal shelter.</p>

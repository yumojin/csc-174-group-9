                  <h2>Personal Information</h2>  
                        <p>My name is Zhengliang Jiang. I was born and grew up in China. I am a senior majoring in computer science.I have taken classes from different computer science major tracks, and found that the track with the focus on human computer interaction interests me the most. The HCI track includes many web programming courses. I took CSC 170 to see how do I feel about web programming  during my sophomore summer and found it to be extremely fascinating. Therefore I decided to follow my interest and the track to take CSC 174 to continue studying web developing. I'm interested in many things such as playing soccer, traveling, and watching movies. Iâ€™ve been a soccer fan since I was a kid. I also played varsity soccer in high school and enjoyed it. </p>
